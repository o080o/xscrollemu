What is xscrollemu?
===================
xscrollemu is a program that emulates the behavior of a scroll wheel when a
certain mouse button is depressed. This lets users of 3-button mice scroll
easily.

By holding down the (configurable) mouse button and moving the mouse up and down
xscrollemu will simulate scroll wheel events tricking programs into scrolling.


Setup and usage
===============
After installing xscrollemu you need to take a look at your X Windows
configuration file (usually /etc/X11/xorg.conf or /etc/X11/XF86Config). In the
"InputDevice" section for your mouse, look for a line similar to:

	Option	"Buttons" "X"

where X is some number. If this number is less than 5, change it to 5. Save this
file.

Now you need to (re)start X Windows and run xscrollemu. By default xscrollemu
uses mouse button 2, which is normally the middle mouse button. Open a program
that will let you scroll (a web browser works), hold down button 2 and move the
mouse around.

If everything works okay, then you'll probably want to make xscrollemu start up
along with X Windows. You can edit ~/.xinitrc or /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc and add
"xscrollemu&" to the beginning (but after the "#!/bin/sh").


The -k option
=============
The -k option allows you to use a specified keyboard key to trigger scrolling.
You need to give the -k option the KeySym of the trigger key. A list of KeySyms
can be found in:

	/usr/X11R6/include/X11/keysymdef.h

For example to make the Windows key the scroll trigger you would run:

	xscrollemu -k 0xFFEB
